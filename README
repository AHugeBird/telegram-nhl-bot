NHL Telegram Bot

This is a hobby project for posting the schedule of NHL games each day in a telegram group. Always and forever a work in progress.

-----

bot.py is the main file through which the bot runs.

If you're gonna build your own bot, you'll need to talk to @BotFather on Telegram to get your own credentials.

Schedule graphics are built using pre-made graphics for each team located in Home and Away Logos folders.

They also use all the other images that are scattered loose in the main directory here. They probably should be in folders, but this seems more exciting.

How you set it up to run automatically is dependent on your workflow. I use fly.io to host it, now that Heroku no longer offers a free tier.
